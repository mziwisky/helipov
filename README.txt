This is the HeliPOV project.  The files within are the fruits of Michael Ziwisky's
labor.  I'm Michael Ziwisky.

Project info can be found at http://mziwisky.wordpress.com/category/helipov/

The project is organized into the following directories:
  pcb -- schematic and pcb design (Cadsoft Eagle files).
  avr -- microcontroller code (written in C).
  imageconv -- code to convert an image file into a sequence of bytes that are
      copied and pasted into the avr code.

I probably haven't documented this stuff very well. If you have questions about
anything, contact me via http://mziwisky.wordpress.com/
